                ♪♪♪♪♪
                I made a promise
                To distance myself
                Took a flight, through aurora skies
                Honestly, I didn't think about
                How we didn't say goodbye
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 10px;">
                Just see you very soon
                It hurts to be something
                It's worse to be nothing with you, mmm
                So I didn't call you
                For sixteen long days
                And I should get a cigarette
                For so much restraint
                No matter how long I resist temptation
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 10px;">
                I will always lose
                It hurts to be something
                It's worse to be nothing with you
                I've done the math
                There's no solution
                We'll never last
                Why can't I let go of this?
                So I broke my promise
                I called you last night
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 10px;">
                I shouldn't have, I wouldn't have
                If it weren't for the sight of a boy
                Who looked just like you
                Standing out on Melrose Avenue
                It hurts to be something
                It's worse to be nothing with you, mmm
                It hurts to be something
                It's worse to be nothing with you
            </p>
